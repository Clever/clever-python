# Clever Python bindings

## Installation
AAABBB

From PyPi:

```bash
    $ pip install clever
```

or

```bash
    $ easy_install clever
```

Or from source:

```bash
    $ python setup.py install
```

## Usage

Get started by importing the `clever` module and setting your authentication method:

```python
    import clever
    clever.set_token('YOUR_OAUTH_TOKEN')
    # or if you're using API key auth
    # clever.set_api_key('YOUR_API_KEY')
```

The `clever` module exposes classes corresponding to resources:

* District
* School
* Section
* Student
* Teacher
* Event

Each exposes a class method `all` that returns a list of all data in that resource that you have access to. Keyword arguments correspond to the same query parameters supported in the HTTP API, except that `limit` and `page` are not supported (pagination is handled automatically).

```python
    schools = clever.School.all() # gets information about all schools you have access to
    schools = clever.School.all(where=json.dumps({'name': 'Of Hard Knocks'}))
    schools = clever.School.all(sort='state')
```

If you'd like more control over pagination, or to limit the number of resources returned, use the `iter` class method:

```python
    students = clever.Student.iter()
    for i in range(0,2000):
        print students.next()
```

The `retrieve` class method takes in a Clever ID and returns a specific resource. The object (or list of objects in the case of `all`) supports accessing properties using either dot notation or dictionary notation:

```python
    demo_school = clever.School.retrieve("4fee004cca2e43cf27000001")
    assert demo_school.name == 'Clever Academy'
    assert demo_school['name'] == 'Clever Academy'
```

## CLI

The library comes with a basic command-line interface:

```bash
    $ export CLEVER_API_KEY=DEMO_KEY
    $ clever districts all
    Running the equivalent of:
    --
    curl https://api.clever.com/v1.1/districts -H "Authorization: Basic REVNT19LRVk="
    --
    Starting new HTTPS connection (1): api.clever.com
    API request to https://api.clever.com/v1.1/districts returned (response code, response body)     of (200, '{"data":[{"data":{"name":"Demo District","id":"4fd43cc56d11340000000005"},"uri":"/v1.1/districts/4fd43cc56d11340000000005"}],"links":[{"rel":"self","uri":"/v1.1/districts"}]}')
    Result (HTTP status code 200):

    --
```
